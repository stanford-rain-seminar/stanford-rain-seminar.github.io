# Stanford RAIN (Research on Algorithms and Incentives in Networks) Seminar

The Internet is a complex network made of both machines and people, and hence, problems in this domain often require techniques from both algorithms and the social sciences. The RAIN (Research on Algorithms and Incentives in Networks) seminar, supported by [SOAL](https://web.stanford.edu/group/soal/), provides a gathering place for talks and social discussion in this area.


* Our talks for the Autumn 2023 quarter are on Mondays 4 PM PT in Y2E2 299!
  (Except for the first talk on 9/29, which is at 2pm in Y2E2 101)
* To receive updates on upcoming talks, please join our [email list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/internetalgs)!

    Even though LP-duality has played a central role in the study of the core, right from its early days to the present time,
basic gaps still remain. I will summarise three papers which address these gaps:

Paper 1 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07627.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07627.pdf) defines new matching-based games, with important applications, and characterizes their cores.
It also gives efficient algorithms for computing core imputations with enhanced fairness properties: 
min-max fair, max-min fair and equitable core imputations.

Paper 2 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00608.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00608.pdf) extends the scope of the notion of core beyond profit --- equivalently cost or utility --- sharing. 
The game in this paper is not a cooperative game, it is a game against nature.

Paper 3 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825622000239?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825622000239?via%3Dihub)  rectifies the fact that the general graph matching game has an empty core by giving the notion of 2/3-approximate core.

# About The Seminar

**Seminar Organizers:** [Itai Ashlagi](http://www.stanford.edu/~iashlagi), [Mohak Goyal](https://sites.google.com/view/mohakg/home), [Tristan Pollner](https://tristanpollner.com).

**Faculty Involved:** [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/), [Ashish Goel](https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/), [Ramesh Johari](http://www.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), [Amin Saberi](https://web.stanford.edu/~saberi/), [Aaron Sidford](https://web.stanford.edu/~sidford/), [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/), [Irene Lo](https://sites.google.com/view/irene-lo), [Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io/).


**Note for Speakers:** The talk is 55 minutes including questions (as we often start a couple of minutes late). If you are giving a talk at RAIN, please plan a 45-50 minute talk since the audience usually ask a lot of questions. Also, the audience is fairly knowledgeable, so speakers should not feel obligated to provide basic game-theoretic, algorithmic, societal, industrial, probabilistic, or statistical background.
