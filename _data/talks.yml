      title: "Multi-objective learning: A unifying framework for robustness, fairness, and collaboration"
      abstract: "Social and real-world considerations such as robustness, fairness, social welfare, and multi-agent tradeoffs have given rise to multi-objective learning paradigms. In recent years, these paradigms have been studied by several disconnected communities and under different names, including collaborative learning, distributional robustness, group fairness, and fair federated learning. In this talk, I will highlight the importance of multi-objective learning paradigms in general, introduce technical tools for addressing them from a simple unifying perspective, and discuss how these problems relate to classical and modern consideration in data-driven processes."

      date: Apr. 5, 2023
      title: "A New Design-Based Framework for Randomized Experiments and the Riesz Estimator"
      abstract: "Randomized experiments are widely used for investigating causal quantities in a variety of settings, from clinical trials and public policy evaluations to development economics and product development. A standard assumption in designing and analyzing such experiments is that of “no-interference”, which states that a participant’s outcome is only affected by their individual treatment and not by the treatments given to other participants in the experiment. Although standard, this assumption does not hold in many experimental settings, e.g. studies of the effect of vaccines where disease may spread between the participants or cash transfer programs where participants may affect local economies containing other participants. 

In this talk, I will present a new design-based experimental framework for formulating and investigating causal quantities under complex interference. The framework is expressive in the sense that it allows experimenters to define and investigate new causal estimands based on continuous or discrete treatment assignments under rich and complex interference structures. We present the Riesz Estimator, which is a unified approach to estimation based on insights from functional analysis. Finally, we derive necessary statistical tools (CLT, variance estimators) to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the causal estimand.

Joint work with Fredrik Sävje and Yitan Wang."

      title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Inventory Management"
      abstract: "We present a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to solving a periodic review inventory control system with stochastic vendor lead times, lost sales, correlated demand, and price matching. While this dynamic program has historically been considered intractable, we show that several policy learning approaches are competitive with or outperform classical baseline approaches. In order to train these algorithms, we develop novel techniques to convert historical data into a simulator and present a collection of results that motivate this approach. We also present a model-based reinforcement learning procedure (Direct Backprop) to solve the dynamic periodic review inventory control problem by constructing a differentiable simulator. Under a variety of metrics Direct Backprop outperforms model-free RL and newsvendor baselines, in both simulations and real-world deployments."

      title: "Reducing Interference Bias in Online Marketplace Experiments using Cluster Randomization: Evidence from a Pricing Meta-Experiment on Airbnb"
      abstract: "Online marketplace designers frequently run randomized experiments to measure the impact of proposed product changes. However, given that marketplaces are inherently connected, total average treatment effect (TATE) estimates obtained through individual-level randomized experiments may be biased due to violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption, a phenomenon we refer to as 'interference bias.' Cluster randomization, i.e., the practice of randomizing treatment assignment at the level of 'clusters' of similar individuals, is an established experiment design technique for countering interference bias in social networks, but it is unclear ex ante if it will be effective in marketplace settings. In this paper, we use a meta-experiment or 'experiment over experiments' conducted on Airbnb to both provide empirical evidence of interference bias in online market settings and assess the viability of cluster randomization as a tool for reducing interference bias in marketplace TATE estimates. Results from our meta-experiment indicate that at least 19.76% of the TATE estimate produced by an individual-randomized evaluation of the platform fee increase we study is attributable to interference bias and eliminated through the use of cluster randomization. We also find suggestive, non-statistically significant evidence that interference bias in seller-side experiments is more severe in demand-constrained markets, and that the efficacy of cluster randomization at reducing interference bias increases with cluster quality"

      title: "More Civility and Positivity for Socially Responsible Language Understanding"
      abstract: "Natural language processing (NLP) has had increasing success and produced extensive industrial applications. Despite being sufficient to enable these applications, current NLP systems often ignore the social part of language, e.g., who says it, in what context, for what goals, which severely limits the functionality of these applications and the growth of the field.  Our research focuses on the social part of language, towards building more socially responsible language technologies.  In this talk, I will take a closer look at social factors in language and share two recent works for promoting more civility and positivity in language use. The first one studies hate speech by introducing a benchmark corpus on implicit hate speech and computational models to detect and explain latent hatred in language. The second examines positive reframing by neutralizing a negative point of view and generating a more positive perspective without contradicting the original meaning."

    - speaker: Jamie Morgenstern
      date: Oct. 26, 2022
      title: "Shifts in Distributions and Preferences in Response to Learning"
      abstract: "Prediction systems face exogenous and endogenous distribution shift -- the world constantly changes, and the predictions the system makes change the environment in which it operates. For example, a music recommender observes exogeneous changes in the user distribution as different communities have increased access to high speed internet. If users under the age of 18 enjoy their recommendations, the proportion of the user base comprised of those under 18 may endogeneously increase. Most of the study of endogenous shifts has focused on the single decision-maker setting, where there is one learner that users either choose to use or not. In this talk, I'll describe several settings where user preferences may cause changes in distributions over the life of an ML system, and how these changes will affect the long-term performance of such systems. Joint work with Sarah Dean, Mihaela Curmei, Maryam Fazhel and Lillian Ratliff."

      date: Nov. 9, 2022
      title: "On the Hardness of Dominant Strategy Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "We study the communication complexity of dominant strategy implementations of combinatorial auctions. We start with two domains that are generally considered easy: multi-unit auctions with decreasing marginal values and combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes valuations. For both domains we have fast algorithms that find the welfare-maximizing allocation with communication complexity that is poly-logarithmic in the input size. This immediately implies that welfare maximization can be achieved in an ex-post equilibrium with no significant communication cost, by using VCG payments. In contrast, we show that in both domains the communication complexity of any dominant strategy implementation that achieves the optimal welfare is polynomial in the input size. We then study the approximation ratios achievable by dominant strategy mechanisms. For combinatorial auctions with general valuations, we show that no dominant-strategy mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of m^(1−eps), where m is the number of items. In contrast, a randomized dominant strategy mechanism that achieves an O(sqrt m) approximation. This proves the first gap between computationally efficient deterministic dominant strategy mechanisms and randomized ones. Joint work with Shiri Ron and Jan Vondrak."

      date: Nov. 16, 2022
      title: "Networks in 3D: Inference for Three-way Social Networks"
      abstract: "Most statistical methods for social network analysis are developed for social structures that consist of directed or undirected ties between two actors. Yet, in many social contexts, relations inherently involve three actors. For example, different people are known to perceive and cognitively represent the networks they are embedded in differently. Understanding differences in perceptions, and how perceptions drive behavior, requires an explicit model of network perception (sender-receiver-peceiver) data. Gossip networks too require a three-way network perspective. In this talk, I will introduce statistical models and inference for static and dynamic three-way network analysis based on incomplete observations."

    - speaker: Thodoris Lykouris
      date: Dec. 7, 2022
      title: "Decentralized multi-agent learning in queuing systems"
      abstract: "Learning in multi-agent systems often poses significant challenges due to interference between agents. In particular, unlike classical stochastic systems, the performance of an agent's action is not drawn i.i.d. from some distribution but is directly affected by the (unobserved) actions of the other agents. This is the reason why most collaborative multi-agent learning approaches aim to globally coordinate all agents' actions to evade this interference. In this talk, we focus on bipartite queuing networks, a common model for two-sided platforms, where N agents request service from K servers. Prior decentralized multi-agent learning approaches have the aforementioned 'global coordination' flavor and therefore suffer from significant shortcomings: they are restricted to symmetric systems, have performance that degrades exponentially in the number of servers, require communication through shared randomness and unique identifiers, and are computationally demanding. In contrast, we provide a simple learning algorithm that, when run decentrally by each agent, avoids the shortcomings of 'global coordination' and leads to efficient performance in general asymmetric bipartite queuing networks while also having additional robustness properties. Along the way, we provide the first UCB-based algorithm for the centralized case of the problem, which resolves an open question by Krishnasamy, Sen, Johari, and Shakkottai (NeurIPS'16 / OR'21). The paper on which this talk is based is joint work with Daniel Freund and Wentao Weng and can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03324. A preliminary version appeared at COLT'22 and Wentao was selected as a finalist in the Applied Probability Society student paper competition for this work."

      title: "The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems, and their Implications for Machine Learning"
      abstract: "The theme of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics was the study of complex systems. At the most basic level, complex systems consist of units and their interactions. In this talk, I will describe each step of a data analysis pipeline suitable for the study of complex systems: from the system dependencies that can manifest themselves in different flavors (temporal, subset, and spatial) to the common mathematical representations (such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), their underlying assumptions, and the dependencies they encode. I will discuss the mathematical relationships between representations and explain how information can be lost (or imputed) when we convert data from one representation to another. I will use examples to highlight the importance of dependencies and careful choice of representations and algorithms when studying complex systems. The main message of the talk is that there is no perfect way to analyze a complex system, and that modeling decisions made when examining a data set from one system are not necessarily transferable to another system, or even to another data set from the same system. Yet, I see many studies apply certain pipelines for seemingly no other reason than because they are common in a particular field. Instead, I recommend evaluating and studying each new complex system and dataset individually and questioning each assumption and modeling decision. This talk is based on the following paper: Leo Torres, Ann Sizemore Blevins, Danielle S. Bassett, Tina Eliassi-Rad: The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems. SIAM Review 63(3): 435-485 (2021), https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1355896. Time permitting, I will describe work on measuring the distance between two graphs by relying on the theory of the length spectrum function from algebraic topology and its relationship to the non-backtracking cycles of a graph. This work is joint with Leo Torres and Pablo Suarez-Serrato, and was published in the Journal of Applied Network Science in June 2019 (http://eliassi.org/papers/appliednetsci19_nbd.pdf)."

      title: "Algorithmic Game Theory Meets Behavioral Economics"
      abstract: "A recent line of work brings together Algorithmic Game Theory and Behavioral Economics. One approach taken in this line of work is to enrich well-studied settings in Algorithmic Game Theory by considering players that exhibit cognitive biases. In this talk, we will discuss two papers demonstrating this approach in two very different settings. The first paper extends the analysis of classic optimal stopping problems by considering agents that have loss aversion relative to a changing reference point and analyzes their behavior. The second paper relies on the literature on lying in behavioral economics and psychology to tackle one of the foundations of Algorithmic Mechanism Design: truthfulness. Based on joint works with Shahar Dobzinski, Bobby Kleinberg and Jon Kleinberg"

      title: "Quantifying hierarchy and dynamics in U.S. faculty hiring and retention"
      abstract: "Faculty hiring and retention determine the composition of the U.S. academic workforce and directly shape educational outcomes, career trajectories, the development and spread of ideas, and research priorities. But patterns in faculty hiring and retention are dynamic, reflecting societal and academic priorities, generational turnover, and long-term efforts to diversify the professoriate along gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines. In this talk, we'll analyze, at unprecedented scale and resolution, the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting U.S. universities over the decade spanning 2011-2020. Focusing on the networks formed when departments hire each other's graduates as faculty, we'll explore the mechanisms shaping these networks as well as the processes of the academic ecosystem that are shaped by them."

      date: Feb. 15, 2023
      title: "When Matching Meets Batching: Optimal Multi-stage Algorithms and Applications"
      abstract: "In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces --- for example matching delivery requests to dispatching centers in Amazon or allocating video-ads to users in YouTube --- the platform allows for some latency (or there is an inherent allowance for latency) in order to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these scenarios, I investigate the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations in this talk. In particular, I consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex weighted bipartite b-matching and AdWords problems in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stage-wise and in K batches—in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for both problems is an optimal (1-(1-1/K)^K)-competitive competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic (1 − 1/e) competitive ratio bound known for the online variants of these problems (Mehta et al., 2007; Aggarwal et al., 2011).

Our main technique at high-level is developing algorithmic tools to vary the trade-off between “greedyness” and “hedging” of the matching algorithm across stages. We rely on a particular family of convex-programming based matchings that distribute the demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages, while carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages. More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight matching linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our fractional multi-stage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multi-stage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm. We extend our results to integral allocations in the vertex weighted b-matching problem with large budgets, and in the AdWords problem with small bid over budget ratios. I will also briefly mention a recent extension of these results to the multi-stage configuration allocation problem and its applications to video-ads.

The talk is based on a series of work with Yiding Feng and Amin Saberi:
