      title: "Decentralized Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "In transaction fee mechanism design, users bid to get their transactions confirmed in the block. Classical auctions completely fail in such a decentralized environment where even the auctioneer (i.e., miners) can be a strategic player. Further, the miners can collude with a subset of the users, e.g., facilitated by real-world platforms like Flashbots. A line of works have attempted to devise a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism but all have failed. In this talk, I will first show that this is not a coincidence --- in fact, there is a fundamental mathematical barrier towards achieving a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism. Then, I will explain how to overcome impossibilities with the help of cryptography, leading to practical mechanisms that achieve good social welfare and revenue."

      title: LP-Duality and the Cores of Games
      abstract: " Even though LP-duality has played a central role in the study of the core, right from its early days to the present time,
basic gaps still remain. I will summarise three papers which address these gaps:

Paper 1 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07627.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07627.pdf) defines new matching-based games, with important applications, and characterizes their cores.
It also gives efficient algorithms for computing core imputations with enhanced fairness properties: 
min-max fair, max-min fair and equitable core imputations.

Paper 2 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00608.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00608.pdf</a> extends the scope of the notion of core beyond profit --- equivalently cost or utility --- sharing. 
The game in this paper is not a cooperative game, it is a game against nature.

Paper 3 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825622000239?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825622000239?via%3Dihub)  rectifies the fact that the general graph matching game has an empty core by giving the notion of 2/3-approximate core."
      bio: "Vijay Vazirani is a distinguished professor at the University of California, Irvine. A description of his research appears in the [citation](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Vijay-Vazirani) of his 2022 INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize. His co-edited book, [Online and Matching-Based Market Design](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/online-and-matchingbased-market-design/604CA9FF1396C489D6497CF336368524#fndtn-information), appeared in July 2023."
