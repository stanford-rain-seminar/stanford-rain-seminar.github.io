      title: Causal inference and LLMs&#58; A new frontier
      abstract: The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their robustness. Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes scenarios. In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open new frontiers for advancing the research, practice, and adoption of causality.

      title: "Decentralized Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "In transaction fee mechanism design, users bid to get their transactions confirmed in the block. Classical auctions completely fail in such a decentralized environment where even the auctioneer (i.e., miners) can be a strategic player. Further, the miners can collude with a subset of the users, e.g., facilitated by real-world platforms like Flashbots. A line of works have attempted to devise a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism but all have failed. In this talk, I will first show that this is not a coincidence --- in fact, there is a fundamental mathematical barrier towards achieving a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism. Then, I will explain how to overcome impossibilities with the help of cryptography, leading to practical mechanisms that achieve good social welfare and revenue."

      title: "Equilibrium Existence and Implementability"
      abstract: "We explore equilibria in markets with money and in pseudomarkets when there are indivisible goods. We show that under a regularity condition, competitive equilibria exist in a transferable utility economy if and only if all random equilibria in a pseudomarket are implementable as a lottery over allocations. Our paper bridges two core models of competitive market designs for indivisible resources and generates new implementability and maximal domain results for pseudomarkets. One consequence is that random equilibria in pseudomarkets are implementable even in the presence of complementarities which feature in existing pseudomarkets, such as course assignment. We provide further equivalence results in the presence of ex-post individual (e.g., technological) constraints, ex-ante individual (e.g., budget) constraints, priorities (e.g., school choice), and ex-post aggregate (e.g., diversity) constraints."
      bio: "Alex Teytelboym is a Professor of Economics at the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, a Tutorial Fellow at St. Catherineâ€™s College, and a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School. He directs the Oxford University Business Economics Programme. His research interests lie mainly in market design and the economics of networks.
