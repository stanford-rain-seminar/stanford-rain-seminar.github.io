      title: "Eliciting Information Without Verification from Humans and Machines"
      abstract: "Many application domains rely on eliciting high-quality (subjective) information. This presentation will talk about how to elicit and aggregate information from both human and machine participants, especially when the information cannot be directly verified. The first part of the talk presents a mechanism, DMI-Mechanism, designed to incentivize truth-telling in the setting where participants are assigned multiple multi-choice questions (e.g. what’s the quality of the above content? High/Low). DMI-Mechanism ensures that truthful responses are more rewarding than any less informative strategy. The implementation of DMI-Mechanism is straightforward, requiring no verification or prior knowledge, and involves only two participants and four questions for binary-choice scenarios. When applied to machine learning, DMI-Mechanism results in a loss function that is invariant to label noise. The second part of the talk discusses the elicitation of information not just from humans but also from machines. Recognizing the limitations in time and resources that humans and machines have, the talk introduces a method to elicit and analyze the 'thinking hierarchy' of both entities. This approach not only facilitates the aggregation of information when the majority of agents are at less sophisticated 'thinking' levels but also provides a unique way to compare humans and machines. This talk is based a series of works including Kong (SODA 2020, ITCS 2022, JACM 2024), Xu, Cao, Kong, Wang (NeurIPS 2019), Kong, Li, Zhang, Huang, Wu (NeurIPS 2022), Huang, Mei, Kong (2024)."

      title: "Decentralized Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "In transaction fee mechanism design, users bid to get their transactions confirmed in the block. Classical auctions completely fail in such a decentralized environment where even the auctioneer (i.e., miners) can be a strategic player. Further, the miners can collude with a subset of the users, e.g., facilitated by real-world platforms like Flashbots. A line of works have attempted to devise a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism but all have failed. In this talk, I will first show that this is not a coincidence --- in fact, there is a fundamental mathematical barrier towards achieving a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism. Then, I will explain how to overcome impossibilities with the help of cryptography, leading to practical mechanisms that achieve good social welfare and revenue."

      title: "Equilibrium Existence and Implementability"
      abstract: "We explore equilibria in markets with money and in pseudomarkets when there are indivisible goods. We show that under a regularity condition, competitive equilibria exist in a transferable utility economy if and only if all random equilibria in a pseudomarket are implementable as a lottery over allocations. Our paper bridges two core models of competitive market designs for indivisible resources and generates new implementability and maximal domain results for pseudomarkets. One consequence is that random equilibria in pseudomarkets are implementable even in the presence of complementarities which feature in existing pseudomarkets, such as course assignment. We provide further equivalence results in the presence of ex-post individual (e.g., technological) constraints, ex-ante individual (e.g., budget) constraints, priorities (e.g., school choice), and ex-post aggregate (e.g., diversity) constraints."

      title: Causal inference and LLMs&#58; A new frontier
      abstract: "The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their robustness. 
      
      Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes scenarios. 
      
      In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open new frontiers for advancing the research, practice, and adoption of causality."

      title: "Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion"
      abstract: "Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect.  In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market).  This paper gives a definition of algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms.  The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect.  Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to collect the data sufficient to pass the audit.  Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., higher-than-competitive prices cannot pass the audit.  The definition allows for the possession of useful side information which, e.g., may be correlated with supply and demand and should affect the prices used by good algorithms.  The paper provides an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate. Joint work with Sheng Long and Chenhao Zhang."

      title: "U-Calibration: Forecasting for an Unknown Agent"
      abstract: "We consider the problem of evaluating forecasts of binary events when predictions are consumed by rational agents who take an action in response to a prediction, but whose utility is unknown to the forecaster. We show that optimizing forecasts for a single scoring rule (e.g., the Brier score) cannot guarantee low regret for all possible agents. In contrast, forecasts that are well-calibrated guarantee that all agents incur sublinear regret. However, calibration is not a necessary criterion here; it is possible for miscalibrated forecasts to provide good regret guarantees for all possible agents. Moreover, calibrated forecasting procedures have provably worse convergence rates than forecasting procedures targeting a single scoring rule. Motivated by this, we present a new metric for evaluating forecasts that we call U-calibration, equal to the maximal regret of the sequence of forecasts when evaluated under any bounded scoring rule. We show that sublinear U-calibration error is a necessary and sufficient condition for all agents to achieve sublinear regret guarantees. We additionally demonstrate how to compute the U-calibration error efficiently and provide an online algorithm that achieves asymptotically optimal U-calibration error (on par with optimal rates for optimizing for a single scoring rule, and bypassing lower bounds for the traditionally calibrated learning procedures). Finally, we discuss generalizations to the multiclass prediction setting. This talk is joint work with Renato Paes Leme, Jon Schneider, and Yifeng Teng."

      title: "Causal Lifting and Causal Identification in Link Prediction using Neural Networks"
      abstract: "In this talk, we consider a small piece of the larger puzzle of endowing state-of-the-art neural networks with the ability to perform causal reasoning. First, we will cover the rich literature on causal identification under peer effects, both under intrinsic factors and path-dependent graph evolution models. Then, I will introduce “Causal Lifting”, which generalizes the earlier causal identification methods for both nodes and edges under network effects, also unveiling a fundamental difference between estimating causal effects on nodes from effects on edges. Finally, we will explore how Causal Lifting aligns causal identification seamlessly with how we design state-of-the-art neural network models for relational reasoning tasks, which can then be integrated with chatbots such as ChatGPT."

      title: "Revisiting revenue maximization for many buyers: buy-many mechanisms and sequential posted pricing"
      abstract: "A recent line of research has established a novel desideratum for designing approximately-revenue-optimal multi-item mechanisms, namely the buy-many constraint. Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the mechanism must be subadditive implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed the sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has enabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing well-established impossibility results.
      Our work addresses a main open question from this literature involving the design of buy-many mechanisms for multiple buyers. We show that a simple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve an O(log m) approximation to the revenue of any buy-many mechanism when all buyers have unit-demand preferences over m items. This is the best approximation possible as it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where no simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation. En route to proving this result we define and prove a multi-dimensional online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) for revenue.
      This is joint work with Rojin Rezvan (UT-Austin), Yifeng Teng (Google Research), and Christos Tzamos (UW-Madison)."

      date: Dec. 11, 2023
      title: "Mechanisms To Procure Information Without Verification"
      abstract: "In a wide variety of contexts including peer grading, peer review, and crowd-sourcing (e.g. evaluating LLM outputs) we would like to design mechanisms which reward agents for producing high quality responses. Unfortunately, computing rewards by comparing to ground truth or gold standard is often cumbersome, costly, or impossible. Instead we would like to compare agent reports. First, we will argue the importance of creating measurements of agent response quality that are both accurate and strategy-proof (agents do not benefit by intentionally falsely reporting).  Second, we will illustrate that previous solutions only achieve one of these desiderata: naïve mechanisms fail to be strategy-proof, yet existing strategy-proof mechanisms are much less accurate than the naïve mechanisms in evaluating response quality. Third, we will show how to create mechanisms that are both strategy-proof and (reasonably) accurate.  The key theoretical technique is a variational interpretation of mutual information, which permits machine learning to estimate mutual information using only a few samples (and likely has other applications in machine learning even beyond the strategic settings). Finally, time permitting, we will survey future directions for the field. "
