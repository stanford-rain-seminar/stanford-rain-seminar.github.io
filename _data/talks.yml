      title: "Greedy Algorithms for Dynamic Matching"
      abstract: |
        We study a foundational model of dynamic matching market with abandonment. This model has been studied by Collina et al (2020) and Aouad and Saritac (2022), and many other papers have considered special cases. We compare the performance of greedy policies -- which identify a set of "acceptable" matches up front, and perform these matches as soon as possible -- to that of an omniscient benchmark which knows the full arrival and departure sequence.

      title: "Contextually Private Mechanisms"
      abstract: |
        We introduce a framework for comparing the privacy of different dynamic mechanisms. A mechanism designer employs a dynamic protocol to elicit agents’ private information. Protocols produce a set of contextual privacy violations—information learned about agents that may be superfluous given the context. A protocol is maximally contextually private if there is no protocol that produces a subset of the violations it produces, while still implementing the choice rule. We show that selecting a maximally contextually private protocol involves a deliberate decision about whose privacy is most important to protect, and these protocols delay questions to those they aim to protect. Taking the second-price auction rule as an instructive example, we derive two novel designs that are maximally contextually private: the ascending-join and overdescending-join protocols.

      title: "Recommendations in high-stakes settings"
      abstract: |
        Recommendation systems are now used in high-stakes settings, including to help find jobs, schools, and partners. Building public-interest recommender systems in such settings brings both individual-level (enabling exploration, diversity, data quality) and societal (fairness, capacity constraints, algorithmic monoculture) challenges. In this talk, I'll discuss our theoretical, empirical, and deployment work in tackling these challenges, including ongoing work on (a) applicant behavior and recommendations for the NYC HS match, (b) a platform to help discharge patients to long-term-care facilities, and (c) feed-ranking algorithms on Bluesky for research-paper recommendations.

      title: "Social Artificial Intelligence"
      abstract: |
        The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) transcends the simple case of human-machine interactions and extends to human-human interactions in the presence of AI. Here, I explore such “hybrid systems” of humans and machines. Our large-sample experiments show how the careful yet simple programming of AI agents can enhance the performance of human groups, making people within such groups better able to cooperate, coordinate, innovate, and communicate, ultimately contributing to their superior performance. On the other hand, both simple and complex forms of AI (such as large language models) can also do the opposite, harming groups of people and our society as a whole. Our experiments show how AI agents can affect social processes and human performance in settings as diverse as people working together online or coordinating their movement on roadways. Our work, in short, does not involve the development of super-smart AI to replace human cognition, but rather “dumb AI” to supplement human interaction. These findings reveal what the disruptive introduction of AI into our lives means for the future of human social behavior. And they suggest ways to design AI — as a type of “social catalyst” — so as to make sure it supports a utopian rather than dystopian future.

      title: "Fair and Representative Citizens' Assemblies"
      abstract: |
        Sortition is based on the idea of choosing randomly selected representatives for decision-making. The main properties that make sortition particularly appealing are fairness and proportional representation. When a population lies on a representation metric, we formally define proportional representation using a notion called the core. Thus, we ask: Can we design a selection algorithm that satisfies fairness and the core simultaneously? We answer this question affirmatively and present an efficient selection algorithm, called Fair Greedy Capture, that is fair and provides a constant-factor approximation to the optimal core.

      abstract: |
        Community Notes empowers people on X to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts. Community Notes have been rated as more trustworthy (bipartisanly) than simple misinformation flags, and cause users to organically like and share noted posts significantly less often. This talk will explore the algorithm behind X's Community Notes, including bridging-based ranking (elevating consensus from people who often disagree via matrix factorization) and a reputation system. We will also touch on newer ideas that aren't yet in production, e.g., generating notes that are predicted to be rated helpful by raters with a diverse set of viewpoints.

      title: "Language Generation in the Limit"
      abstract: |
        Although current large language models are complex, the most basic specifications of the underlying language generation problem itself are simple to state: given a finite set of training samples from an unknown language, produce valid new strings from the language that don't already appear in the training data. Here we ask what we can conclude about language generation using only this specification, without further properties or distributional assumptions. In particular, we consider models in which an adversary enumerates the strings of an unknown target language that is known only to come from one of a possibly infinite list of candidates, and the goal is to generate new strings from this target language; we show that it is possible to give certain non-trivial guarantees for language generation in this setting. The resulting guarantees contrast dramatically with negative results due to Gold and Angluin in a well-studied model of language learning where the goal is to identify an unknown language from samples; the difference between these results suggests that identifying a language is a fundamentally different problem than generating from it. (This is joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan.)

      title: "Solving Games Forwards and Backwards"
      abstract: |
        Computing equilibria in games is a problem of great interest in both economics and computer science. We present a min-max formulation of this problem, in which the minimizer seeks an equilibrium solution for the game, while the maximizer seeks to find fault with the proposed solutions. We call this the "forward" problem. In the "backwards" problem, we are instead given an equilibrium and a parameterized game, and we are interested in inferring a game from that equilibrium—that is, identifying the game parameters that induce the observed equilibrium. We consider the backwards problem under increasingly weaker assumptions, ranging from inverse multi-agent planning to inverse multi-agent learning and beyond, each with corresponding min-max formulations. While it can be difficult to ensure that the min-max formulation of a forward problem is convex-concave (and thus amenable to solutions such as gradient-descent ascent), we find it easier to ensure that the min-max formulation of a backward problem is convex-concave. We apply our backwards method to Spanish electricity-market time-series data and then push the inferred game forward to predict future market prices. (Joint work with Denizalp Goktas and Sadie Zhao.)

      title: "Rank-Guaranteed Auctions"
      abstract: |
        We propose a combinatorial ascending auction that is "approximately" optimal, requiring minimal rationality to achieve this level of optimality, and is robust to strategic and distributional uncertainties. Specifically, the auction is rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the ex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue achievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M| + 1)th-highest valuation for each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of combinatorial-auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple and approximately optimal menus in various settings.

      title: "Incentivizing Resource Pooling"
      abstract: |
        Resource pooling improves system efficiency drastically in large stochastic systems, but its effective implementation in decentralized systems remains relatively underexplored. This paper studies how to incentivize resource pooling when agents are self-interested and their states are private information. Our primary motivation is applications in the design of decentralized computing markets, among others. We study a standard multi-server queueing model in which each server is associated with an M/M/1 queue and aims to minimize its time-average job holding and processing costs. We design a simple token-based mechanism where servers can earn tokens by offering help and spend tokens to request help from other servers, all in their self-interest. The mechanism induces a complex game among servers. We employ the fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) concept to analyze the system, combining mean-field approximation with fluid relaxation. This framework enables us to derive a closed-form characterization of servers' FMFE strategies. We show that these FMFE strategies approximate well the servers' rational behavior. We leverage this framework to optimize the design of the mechanism and present our main results: As the number of servers increases, the proposed mechanism incentivizes complete resource pooling—namely, the system dynamics and performance under our mechanism match those under centralized control.

      abstract: |
        Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent text and completing various natural-language tasks. Nevertheless, their ability to perform complex, general reasoning has remained limited. In this talk, I will describe OpenAI's new o1 model, an LLM trained via reinforcement learning to generate a hidden chain of thought before its response. We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement-learning compute and with more inference compute. o1 surpasses previous state-of-the-art models on a variety of benchmarks that require reasoning, including mathematics competitions, programming contests, and advanced science question sets. I will discuss the implications of scaling this paradigm even further.

      title: "The Dedicated Docket in U.S. Immigration Courts: An Analysis of Fairness and Efficiency Properties"
      abstract: |
        In this talk I will give an overview of my recent work at the intersection of humanitarian immigration and operations, with a particular focus on the dedicated docket program. The dedicated docket was introduced by the Biden Administration to reform the asylum system. It creates a separate queue for court proceedings in which judges are supposed to issue decisions for each case within a target time frame. Its goals are to improve speed, accuracy, and fairness. Though it meets its first goal, legal advocacy groups report that this comes at the expense of the last. Referring to it as a "denial of justice," they find that cases on the dedicated docket routinely fail to access legal representation and have a much lower asylum-grant rate. Against this backdrop, we study the operational implications of a dedicated-docket system. We develop a queueing model in which a policy-maker routes asylees to the regular or the dedicated docket and sets a delay target for the latter. Constrained by the target, the court allocates its capacity to minimize average delay, and immigration lawyers schedule their time between dockets to maximize the rate of successful asylum cases. Compared to a single docket, we show that the dedicated-docket system can Pareto-improve speed and accuracy. However, we also prove that the system satisfies two natural fairness rules only if it is dominated in speed and accuracy by the single docket. Our analysis can guide public discourse by informing both policymakers and legal advocacy groups of the necessary trade-offs involved in scheduling decisions in the asylum context.
