      title: "Learning to Reason with LLMs"
      abstract: "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent text and completing various natural language tasks. Nevertheless, their ability to perform complex, general reasoning has remained limited. In this talk, I will describe OpenAI's new o1 model, an LLM trained via reinforcement learning to generate a hidden chain of thought before its response. We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement learning compute and with more inference compute. o1 surpasses previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of benchmarks that require reasoning, including mathematics competitions, programming contests, and advanced science question sets. I will discuss the implications of scaling this paradigm even further."

      title: "Language Generation in the Limit"
      abstract: "Although current large language models are complex, the most basic specifications of the underlying language generation problem itself are simple to state: given a finite set of training samples from an unknown language, produce valid new strings from the language that don't already appear in the training data. Here we ask what we can conclude about language generation using only this specification, without further properties or distributional assumptions. In particular, we consider models in which an adversary enumerates the strings of an unknown target language that is known only to come from one of a possibly infinite list of candidates, and the goal is to generate new strings from this target language; we show that it is possible to give certain non-trivial guarantees for language generation in this setting. The resulting guarantees contrast dramatically with negative results due to Gold and Angluin in a well-studied model of language learning where the goal is to identify an unknown language from samples; the difference between these results suggests that identifying a language is a fundamentally different problem than generating from it. (This is joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan.)"

      title: "Solving Games Forwards and Backwards"
      abstract: "Computing equilibria in games is a problem of great interest in both economics and computer science. We present a min-max formulation of this problem, in which the minimizer seeks an equilibrium solution for the game, while the maximizer seeks to find fault with the proposed solutions. We call this problem the 'forward' problem. In the 'backwards' problem, we are instead given an equilibrium and a parameterized game, and we are interested in inferring a game from that equilibrium: i.e., identifying the game parameters that induce the observed equilibrium. We consider the backwards problem under weaker and weaker assumptions, ranging from inverse multiagent planning to inverse multiagent learning and beyond, for each of which we present min-max formulations. While it can be difficult to ensure that the min-max formulation of a forward problem is convex-concave, and thus amenable to standard solutions (e.g., gradient descent ascent), we find it easier to ensure that the min-max formulation of a backward problem is convex-concave. We apply our backwards method to Spanish electricity market time-series data, and then push the inferred game forward to predict future market prices. Joint work with Denizalp Goktas and Sadie Zhao."

      title: "Rank-Guaranteed Auctions"
      abstract: "We propose a combinatorial ascending auction that is 'approximately' optimal, requiring minimal rationality to achieve this level of optimality, and is robust to strategic and distributional uncertainties. Specifically, the auction is rank-guaranteed, meaning that for any menu M and any valuation profile, the ex-post revenue is guaranteed to be at least as high as the highest revenue achievable from feasible allocations, taking the (|M| + 1)th-highest valuation for each bundle as the price. Our analysis highlights a crucial aspect of combinatorial auction design, namely, the design of menus. We provide simple and approximately optimal menus in various settings."

      title: "Incentivizing Resource Pooling"
      abstract: "Resource pooling improves system efficiency drastically in large stochastic systems, but its effective implementation in decentralized systems remains relatively underexplored. This paper studies how to incentivize resource pooling when agents are self-interested, and their states are private information. Our primary motivation is applications in the design of decentralized computing markets, among others. We study a standard multi-server queueing model in which each server is associated with an M/M/1 queue and aims to minimize its time-average job holding and processing costs. We design a simple token-based mechanism where servers can earn tokens by offering help and spend tokens to request help from other servers, all in their self-interest. The mechanism induces a complex game among servers. We employ the fluid mean-field equilibrium (FMFE) concept to analyze the system, combining mean-field approximation with fluid relaxation. This framework enables us to derive a closed-form characterization of servers' FMFE strategies. We show that these FMFE strategies approximate well the servers' rational behavior. We leverage this framework to optimize the design of the mechanism and present our main results: As the number of servers increases, the proposed mechanism incentivizes complete resource pooling---that is, the system dynamics and performance under our mechanism match those under centralized control."
