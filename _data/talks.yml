      title: "Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions"
      abstract: |
        We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over T rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an m-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits m bid-quantity pairs (bi, qi) to demand qi units at bid bi, with m ≪ M in practice, where M denotes the buyer's maximum demand. We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the bidder's valuation curve, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is exponential in m, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy. We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio α ∈ (0, 1] as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of α. Our algorithm achieves α-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.

      title: "Why Language Models Hallucinate"
      abstract: |
        Large language models (LLMs) sometimes generate statements that are plausible but factually incorrect—a phenomenon commonly called "hallucination." We argue that these errors are not mysterious failures of architecture or reasoning, but rather predictable consequences of standard training and evaluation incentives. We show (i) that hallucinations can be viewed as classification errors: when pretrained models cannot reliably distinguish a false statement from a true one, they may produce the false option rather than saying I don't know; (ii) that optimization of benchmark performance encourages guessing rather than abstaining, since most evaluation metrics penalize expressing uncertainty; and (iii) that a possible mitigation path lies in revising existing benchmarks to reward calibrated abstention, thus realigning incentives in model development. Joint work with Santosh Vempala (Georgia Tech) and Ofir Nachum & Edwin Zhang (OpenAI).

      title: "Bridging the Gap Between Research and Policy in AI Safety and Accountability"
      abstract: |
        As AI becomes increasingly integrated into both the private and public sectors, challenges around AI safety and policy have arisen. There is a growing, compelling body of work around the legal and societal challenges that come with AI, but there is a gap in our rigorous understanding of these problems. In this talk, I dive deep into a few topics in AI safety and policy. We will discuss AI supply chains (the increasingly complex ecosystem of AI actors and components that contribute to AI products) and study how AI supply chains complicate machine learning objectives. We'll then shift our discussion to AI audits and evidentiary burdens in cases involving AI. Using Pareto frontiers as a tool for assessing performance-fairness tradeoffs, we will show how a closed-form expression for performance-fairness Pareto frontiers can help plaintiffs (or auditors) overcome evidentiary burdens or a lack of access in AI contexts. I'll conclude with a longitudinal study of LLMs during the 2024 US election season. If time permits, we may touch on formal notions of trustworthiness.

      title: "Building aligned agents for open-universe tasks"
      abstract: |
        As agents move from the lab into real-world settings, designers have a limited ability to anticipate the agent's context and design explicit safeguards. In this talk, I will outline challenges that this raises from the perspective of designing flexible, robust, and aligned agent behaviors. The key to the approach is to design agents that can model and respond to appropriate uncertainty about a user's intended goal and the normative environment they are deployed into. I will begin with a survey of current alignment techniques and AI agents, then outline the theoretical motivation for this approach. Next, I will describe recent work from my lab that attempts to address this problem by 1) designing flexible goal inference mechanisms that can track the set of plausible user goals reliably from context; and 2) integrating these inference tools with efficient agent designs that leverage POMDP solvers in order to train agents that implement belief-constrained behaviors. I will conclude with a discussion of recent work that evaluates collaborative agents and discuss the implications for the design of aligned systems that augment and integrate with human users and intent.

      title: "Democratizing Optimization via Generative AI"
      abstract: |
        From healthcare delivery to resilient power grid management, optimization has the potential to improve decision-making for some of today's most pressing problems, but its use is often limited by the mathematical expertise required to model and solve complex problems. This talk will showcase the potential of generative AI to lower this barrier and democratize access to advanced optimization tools. Motivated by a collaboration with Microsoft Outlook, the first part of the talk will present a novel framework for interactive decision support for non-expert users that leverages large language models (LLM) to translate user requests into an underlying constraint programming model. We investigate this framework through the lens of meeting scheduling, and showcase its potential via a user study with a prototype system. In the second part of the talk, we demonstrate how LLMs can be used to automatically generate problem-specific optimization solver configurations, a challenging task for even expert optimization users. Our approach achieves up to 70% speed-ups over default solver settings with little-to-no additional compute. We will conclude by discussing broader opportunities for integrating natural language and optimization, moving toward a future where powerful decision-making tools are as accessible for managers at a local food bank as they are for applied scientists at Amazon.

      title: "LLM Evaluation for the Real World"
      abstract: | 
        Traditional evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs)—often centered on accuracy in static multiple-choice or short-answer questions—fail to capture real-world complexities. As LLMs increasingly serve users in dynamic, multicultural contexts, we must redefine meaningful evaluation. This talk presents our recent research advancing LLM evaluation through culturally aware, socially grounded, and customizable benchmarks. We assess factual consistency across languages, everyday knowledge in underrepresented cultures, and cultural inclusivity. We highlight that biases become evident in generation tasks, reflecting actual LLM use. Central to our approach is BenchHub, a unified benchmark suite categorizing over 300,000 questions across diverse domains and cultures, enabling tailored evaluations. BenchHub underscores domain-specific variations and the critical role benchmark composition plays in LLM performance rankings. These insights demonstrate that accuracy alone is insufficient; comprehensive LLM evaluation must consider culture, context, and customization. This talk advocates a broader evaluation agenda, presenting foundational steps toward robust, inclusive assessments.

      title: "Distortion of Learning and AI Alignment from Heterogenous Human Feedback"
      abstract: |
        After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences based on crowdsourced pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods produce models that satisfy users in any meaningful way.  In this work, we ask a deceptively simple yet foundational question: Do state-of-the-art alignment methods actually produce models that satisfy users on average in the presence of heterogeneous preferences? Drawing on social choice theory, and modeling each user's comparisons via an individual Bradley–Terry (BT) model, we introduce the distortion of an alignment method: the worst-case ratio between the optimal achievable average utility and the average utility of the learned policy. This notion yields concrete insights into alignment with heterogeneous preferences. In particular, we establish an impossibility result for aligning to average user utility — counter to the conventional wisdom that ML methods, even if imperfect for every individual, at least perform well on average. Distortion also highlights sharp differences between alignment methods: we show that widely used approaches such as RLHF and DPO can have exponentially large — or even unbounded — distortion, whereas a constant minimax-optimal distortion is achievable via a method inspired by social choice theory, known as maximal lotteries, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback.

      title: "Data Attribution, Selection, and Valuation at Scale with Metagradients"
      abstract: |
        Training data is now recognized as a key driver the performance of AI systems. Indeed, AI companies are signing multi-million dollar deals for training data acquisition, raising the question: how "should" this training data be priced? Understanding how to value training data requires us to understand the downstream impact of this data on model behavior---which is made challenging by the complex, uninterpretable nature of large-scale ML models.
        In the first part of this talk, we present some recent work on tracing back model performance to training data---improving on a long line of prior work in machine learning, our method can optimally (in a natural sense) predict the impact of training data on model performance. In the second part of the talk, we propose a framework for studying data pricing theoretically, inspired by our experimental results in the first part of the talk. We conclude with some open questions and directions.
