      title: "Decentralized Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "In transaction fee mechanism design, users bid to get their transactions confirmed in the block. Classical auctions completely fail in such a decentralized environment where even the auctioneer (i.e., miners) can be a strategic player. Further, the miners can collude with a subset of the users, e.g., facilitated by real-world platforms like Flashbots. A line of works have attempted to devise a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism but all have failed. In this talk, I will first show that this is not a coincidence --- in fact, there is a fundamental mathematical barrier towards achieving a 'dream' transaction fee mechanism. Then, I will explain how to overcome impossibilities with the help of cryptography, leading to practical mechanisms that achieve good social welfare and revenue."

      title: "Equilibrium Existence and Implementability"
      abstract: "We explore equilibria in markets with money and in pseudomarkets when there are indivisible goods. We show that under a regularity condition, competitive equilibria exist in a transferable utility economy if and only if all random equilibria in a pseudomarket are implementable as a lottery over allocations. Our paper bridges two core models of competitive market designs for indivisible resources and generates new implementability and maximal domain results for pseudomarkets. One consequence is that random equilibria in pseudomarkets are implementable even in the presence of complementarities which feature in existing pseudomarkets, such as course assignment. We provide further equivalence results in the presence of ex-post individual (e.g., technological) constraints, ex-ante individual (e.g., budget) constraints, priorities (e.g., school choice), and ex-post aggregate (e.g., diversity) constraints."

      title: Causal inference and LLMs&#58; A new frontier
      abstract: "The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their robustness. 
      
      Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes scenarios. 
      
      In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open new frontiers for advancing the research, practice, and adoption of causality."

      date: Oct. 30, 2023
      title: "Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion"
      abstract: "Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect.  In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market).  This paper gives a definition of algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms.  The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect.  Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to collect the data sufficient to pass the audit.  Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., higher-than-competitive prices cannot pass the audit.  The definition allows for the possession of useful side information which, e.g., may be correlated with supply and demand and should affect the prices used by good algorithms.  The paper provides an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate. Joint work with Sheng Long and Chenhao Zhang."

      date: Nov. 6, 2023
      title: "U-Calibration: Forecasting for an Unknown Agent"
      abstract: "We consider the problem of evaluating forecasts of binary events when predictions are consumed by rational agents who take an action in response to a prediction, but whose utility is unknown to the forecaster. We show that optimizing forecasts for a single scoring rule (e.g., the Brier score) cannot guarantee low regret for all possible agents. In contrast, forecasts that are well-calibrated guarantee that all agents incur sublinear regret. However, calibration is not a necessary criterion here; it is possible for miscalibrated forecasts to provide good regret guarantees for all possible agents. Moreover, calibrated forecasting procedures have provably worse convergence rates than forecasting procedures targeting a single scoring rule. Motivated by this, we present a new metric for evaluating forecasts that we call U-calibration, equal to the maximal regret of the sequence of forecasts when evaluated under any bounded scoring rule. We show that sublinear U-calibration error is a necessary and sufficient condition for all agents to achieve sublinear regret guarantees. We additionally demonstrate how to compute the U-calibration error efficiently and provide an online algorithm that achieves asymptotically optimal U-calibration error (on par with optimal rates for optimizing for a single scoring rule, and bypassing lower bounds for the traditionally calibrated learning procedures). Finally, we discuss generalizations to the multiclass prediction setting. This talk is joint work with Renato Paes Leme, Jon Schneider, and Yifeng Teng."

      date: Nov. 13, 2023
      title: "Causal Lifting and Causal Identification in Link Prediction using Neural Networks"
      abstract: "In this talk, we consider a small piece of the larger puzzle of endowing state-of-the-art neural networks with the ability to perform causal reasoning. First, we will cover the rich literature on causal identification under peer effects, both under intrinsic factors and path-dependent graph evolution models. Then, I will introduce “Causal Lifting”, which generalizes the earlier causal identification methods for both nodes and edges under network effects, also unveiling a fundamental difference between estimating causal effects on nodes from effects on edges. Finally, we will explore how Causal Lifting aligns causal identification seamlessly with how we design state-of-the-art neural network models for relational reasoning tasks, which can then be integrated with chatbots such as ChatGPT."

      title: "Revisiting revenue maximization for many buyers: buy-many mechanisms and sequential posted pricing"
      abstract: "A recent line of research has established a novel desideratum for designing approximately-revenue-optimal multi-item mechanisms, namely the buy-many constraint. Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the mechanism must be subadditive implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed the sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has enabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing well-established impossibility results.
      Our work addresses a main open question from this literature involving the design of buy-many mechanisms for multiple buyers. We show that a simple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve an O(log m) approximation to the revenue of any buy-many mechanism when all buyers have unit-demand preferences over m items. This is the best approximation possible as it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where no simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation. En route to proving this result we define and prove a multi-dimensional online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) for revenue.
      This is joint work with Rojin Rezvan (UT-Austin), Yifeng Teng (Google Research), and Christos Tzamos (UW-Madison)."

    - speaker: Grant Schoenebeck
      date: Dec. 11, 2023
      title: "Mechanisms To Procure Information Without Verification"
      abstract: "In a wide variety of contexts including peer grading, peer review, and crowd-sourcing (e.g. evaluating LLM outputs) we would like to design mechanisms which reward agents for producing high quality responses. Unfortunately, computing rewards by comparing to ground truth or gold standard is often cumbersome, costly, or impossible. Instead we would like to compare agent reports. First, we will argue the importance of creating measurements of agent response quality that are both accurate and strategy-proof (agents do not benefit by intentionally falsely reporting).  Second, we will illustrate that previous solutions only achieve one of these desiderata: naïve mechanisms fail to be strategy-proof, yet existing strategy-proof mechanisms are much less accurate than the naïve mechanisms in evaluating response quality. Third, we will show how to create mechanisms that are both strategy-proof and (reasonably) accurate.  The key theoretical technique is a variational interpretation of mutual information, which permits machine learning to estimate mutual information using only a few samples (and likely has other applications in machine learning even beyond the strategic settings). Finally, time permitting, we will survey future directions for the field. "

    - speaker: Yuqing Kong
      date: Feb. 12, 2024
      title: "Eliciting Information Without Verification from Humans and Machines"
      abstract: "Many application domains rely on eliciting high-quality (subjective) information. This presentation will talk about how to elicit and aggregate information from both human and machine participants, especially when the information cannot be directly verified. The first part of the talk presents a mechanism, DMI-Mechanism, designed to incentivize truth-telling in the setting where participants are assigned multiple multi-choice questions (e.g. what’s the quality of the above content? High/Low). DMI-Mechanism ensures that truthful responses are more rewarding than any less informative strategy. The implementation of DMI-Mechanism is straightforward, requiring no verification or prior knowledge, and involves only two participants and four questions for binary-choice scenarios. When applied to machine learning, DMI-Mechanism results in a loss function that is invariant to label noise. The second part of the talk discusses the elicitation of information not just from humans but also from machines. Recognizing the limitations in time and resources that humans and machines have, the talk introduces a method to elicit and analyze the 'thinking hierarchy' of both entities. This approach not only facilitates the aggregation of information when the majority of agents are at less sophisticated 'thinking' levels but also provides a unique way to compare humans and machines. This talk is based a series of works including Kong (SODA 2020, ITCS 2022, JACM 2024), Xu, Cao, Kong, Wang (NeurIPS 2019), Kong, Li, Zhang, Huang, Wu (NeurIPS 2022), Huang, Mei, Kong (2024)."

    - speaker: Panos Toulis 
      date: Feb. 26, 2024
      title: "Experimental Designs for Structural Economic Models on Large Networks"
      abstract: "This talk presents an ongoing large field experiment in a country of South America that randomizes tax audit notices (treatment) to firms connected through a large network of VAT transactions. While the ultimate goal is to optimize tax audit policy, the short-term goal is to estimate causal effects of tax audit notices on firm behavior. Of particular interest is to understand spillovers, that is, the response of firms that are not treated but are connected to other firms that are treated. First, I will discuss why current popular approaches to experimenting on networks are limited by the reality of inter-firm networks, such as their size, high interconnectivity and heavy-tailed degree distributions. I will then describe an approach to experimentation that leverages subtle sub-structures in the network. This approach is specifically designed to allow the application of Fisherian-style permutation tests of causal effects. These testing procedures are computationally efficient and finite-sample valid, qualities that are important for testing in a robust way the parameters of structural economic models."
      bio: "Panos Toulis studies causal inference in complex settings (e.g., networks) through resampling methods such as permutation tests.

      title: "Simulation is All You Need"
      abstract: "Motivated by online matching markets and network revenue management (NRM) problems with many types (e.g., fulfillment optimization), we study dynamic spatial matching (DSM) in which supply and demand live in d dimensional space and need to be matched with each other dynamically. If demand and supply have the same spatial distribution, greedy matching suffices, and achieves average match distance of the same order as the distance to the nearest neighbor, *except* for the case of d=1 and both supply and demand arriving dynamically over time. If demand and supply have different spatial distributions, the matching constraint has bite and greedy matching fails. We introduce a unifying and practical algorithmic principle for NRM and DSM dubbed SOAR: Simulate, Optimize, Assign, Repeat, which repeatedly simulates the future to enable good matching decisions. Simulating one sample path at each stage already enables SOAR to produce near optimal regret for the majority of NRM models in the literature, and for DSM with non-atomic demand and supply distributions. For more challenging NRM and DSM models, SOAR with multiple simulated sample paths at each stage achieves near optimal regret."

    - speaker: David Shmoys
      date: Apr. 4, 2024
      title: "Algorithmic Tools for Redistricting: Fairness via Analytics"
      abstract: "The American winner-take-all congressional district system empowers politicians to engineer electoral outcomes by manipulating district boundaries. To date, computational solutions mostly focus on drawing unbiased maps by ignoring political and demographic input, and instead simply optimize for compactness and other related metrics. However, we maintain that this is a flawed approach because compactness and fairness are orthogonal qualities; to achieve a meaningful notion of fairness, one needs to model political and demographic considerations, using historical data. We will discuss a series of papers that explore and develop this perspective. In the first (joint with Wes Gurnee), we present a scalable approach to explicitly optimize for arbitrary piecewise-linear definitions of fairness; this employs a stochastic hierarchical decomposition approach to produce an exponential number of distinct district plans that can be optimized via a standard set partitioning integer programming formulation. This enables a large-scale ensemble study of congressional districts, providing insights into the range of possible expected outcomes and the implications of this range on potential definitions of fairness. Further work extending this (joint with Julia Allen & Wes Gurnee), shows that many additional real-world constraints can be easily adapted in this framework (such as minimal county splits as was recently required in Alabama legislation in response to the US Supreme Court decision Milligan v. Alabama). In another paper (joint with Nikhil Garg, Wes Gurnee, and David Rothschild), we study the design of multi-member districts (MMDs) in which each district elects multiple representatives, potentially through a non-winner-takes-all voting rule (as was proposed in H.R. 4000). We carry out large-scale analyses for the U.S. House of Representatives under MMDs with different social choice functions, under algorithmically generated maps optimized for either partisan benefit or proportionality. We find that with three-member districts using Single Transferable Vote, fairness-minded independent commissions can achieve proportional outcomes in every state (up to rounding), and this would significantly curtail the power of advantage-seeking partisans to gerrymander."

      title: "The Computer in the Sky"
      abstract: "Turing-complete blockchain protocols approximate the idealized abstraction of a computer in the sky that is open access, runs in plain view, and, in effect, has no owner or operator. This technology can, among other things, enable stronger notions of ownership of digital possessions than we have ever had before. Building the computer in the sky is hard (and scientifically fascinating), and in this talk I'll highlight three threads in my recent research on this challenge: Possibility and impossibility results for permissionless consensus protocols (i.e., implementing an “ownerless” computer). Incentive-compatible transaction fee mechanism design (i.e., making an “open-access” computer sustainable and welfare-maximizing). A Black-Scholes-type formula for quantifying adverse selection in automated market makers (some of the most popular 'programs' running on the computer in the sky). The talk will emphasize the diversity of mathematical tools necessary for understanding blockchain protocols and their applications (e.g., distributed computing, game theory, mechanism design, and continuous-time stochastic processes) and the immediate practical impact that mathematical work on this topic has had (e.g., Ethereum's EIP-1559 and LVR for automated market makers)."

      title: "Mechanism Design for Collaborative Normal Mean Estimation"
      abstract: "Due to the popularity of machine learning, many organizations view data as an invaluable resource, likening it to the \"new oil/gold\". However, unlike other types of resources, data can be freely replicated and used by many. Hence, data produced by one organization, can, in principle, generate limitless value to many others. This will accelerate economic, social, and scientific breakthroughs and benefit society at large. However, strategic considerations such as free-riding,  competition, and data monetization may prevent such open sharing of data between organizations. In this talk, I will focus on free-riding, and show that in naive mechanisms for data sharing, agents may attempt to benefit from the data that the others have collected without contributing any themselves. Free-riding can manifest in strategic behavior such as under-collecting data, or submitting fabricated datasets.

I will present some of our recent work where we study these challenges in one of the most foundational statistical problems, normal mean estimation. Here, a set of strategic agents collect i.i.d samples from a normal distribution at a cost, and wish to estimate the mean of this distribution. To facilitate collaboration, we design mechanisms that incentivize agents to collect a sufficient amount of data and share it truthfully, so that they are all better off than working alone. Our approach prevents under-collection and data fabrication via two key techniques: first, when sharing the others’ data with an agent, the mechanism corrupts this dataset proportional to how much the data reported by the agent differs from the others; second, we design minimax optimal estimators for the corrupted dataset. Our mechanism, which is Nash incentive compatible and individually rational, achieves a social penalty (sum of all agents’ estimation errors and data collection costs) that is at most a factor 2 of the global minimum. When extending this work to high dimensional (non-Gaussian) distributions with bounded variance, where agents have heterogeneous data collection capabilities, our mechanisms retain these properties, but with slightly weaker results.

This is joint work with Yiding Chen, Alex Clinton, and Jerry Zhu."
