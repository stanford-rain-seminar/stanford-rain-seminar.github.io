      title: "Robust Mechanisms for the Financing of Public Goods"
      abstract: "We propose a novel proportional cost-sharing mechanism for funding public goods with interdependent values: the agents simultaneously submit bids, which are nonnegative numbers; the expenditure on the public good is an increasing and concave function of the sum of the bids; and each agent is responsible for the fraction of the expenditure proportional to their bid. The proportional cost-sharing mechanism provides a non-trivial guarantee for social welfare, regardless of the structure of the agents’ information and the equilibrium that is played, as long as the social value for the public good is sufficiently large. Moreover, this guarantee is shown to be unimprovable in environments where the designer knows a lower bound on the social value. The guarantee converges to the entire efficient surplus when the social value grows large. When there are two agents, our model can be reinterpreted as one of bilateral trade, and the proportional cost-sharing is reinterpreted as proportional pricing."

      title: "More Civility and Positivity for Socially Responsible Language Understanding"
      abstract: "Natural language processing (NLP) has had increasing success and produced extensive industrial applications. Despite being sufficient to enable these applications, current NLP systems often ignore the social part of language, e.g., who says it, in what context, for what goals, which severely limits the functionality of these applications and the growth of the field.  Our research focuses on the social part of language, towards building more socially responsible language technologies.  In this talk, I will take a closer look at social factors in language and share two recent works for promoting more civility and positivity in language use. The first one studies hate speech by introducing a benchmark corpus on implicit hate speech and computational models to detect and explain latent hatred in language. The second examines positive reframing by neutralizing a negative point of view and generating a more positive perspective without contradicting the original meaning."

      title: "Shifts in Distributions and Preferences in Response to Learning"
      abstract: "Prediction systems face exogenous and endogenous distribution shift -- the world constantly changes, and the predictions the system makes change the environment in which it operates. For example, a music recommender observes exogeneous changes in the user distribution as different communities have increased access to high speed internet. If users under the age of 18 enjoy their recommendations, the proportion of the user base comprised of those under 18 may endogeneously increase. Most of the study of endogenous shifts has focused on the single decision-maker setting, where there is one learner that users either choose to use or not. In this talk, I'll describe several settings where user preferences may cause changes in distributions over the life of an ML system, and how these changes will affect the long-term performance of such systems. Joint work with Sarah Dean, Mihaela Curmei, Maryam Fazhel and Lillian Ratliff."

      title: "On the Hardness of Dominant Strategy Mechanism Design"
      abstract: "We study the communication complexity of dominant strategy implementations of combinatorial auctions. We start with two domains that are generally considered easy: multi-unit auctions with decreasing marginal values and combinatorial auctions with gross substitutes valuations. For both domains we have fast algorithms that find the welfare-maximizing allocation with communication complexity that is poly-logarithmic in the input size. This immediately implies that welfare maximization can be achieved in an ex-post equilibrium with no significant communication cost, by using VCG payments. In contrast, we show that in both domains the communication complexity of any dominant strategy implementation that achieves the optimal welfare is polynomial in the input size. We then study the approximation ratios achievable by dominant strategy mechanisms. For combinatorial auctions with general valuations, we show that no dominant-strategy mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of m^(1−eps), where m is the number of items. In contrast, a randomized dominant strategy mechanism that achieves an O(sqrt m) approximation. This proves the first gap between computationally efficient deterministic dominant strategy mechanisms and randomized ones. Joint work with Shiri Ron and Jan Vondrak."

      title: "Networks in 3D: Inference for Three-way Social Networks"
      abstract: "Most statistical methods for social network analysis are developed for social structures that consist of directed or undirected ties between two actors. Yet, in many social contexts, relations inherently involve three actors. For example, different people are known to perceive and cognitively represent the networks they are embedded in differently. Understanding differences in perceptions, and how perceptions drive behavior, requires an explicit model of network perception (sender-receiver-peceiver) data. Gossip networks too require a three-way network perspective. In this talk, I will introduce statistical models and inference for static and dynamic three-way network analysis based on incomplete observations."

      title: "Decentralized multi-agent learning in queuing systems"
      abstract: "Learning in multi-agent systems often poses significant challenges due to interference between agents. In particular, unlike classical stochastic systems, the performance of an agent's action is not drawn i.i.d. from some distribution but is directly affected by the (unobserved) actions of the other agents. This is the reason why most collaborative multi-agent learning approaches aim to globally coordinate all agents' actions to evade this interference. In this talk, we focus on bipartite queuing networks, a common model for two-sided platforms, where N agents request service from K servers. Prior decentralized multi-agent learning approaches have the aforementioned 'global coordination' flavor and therefore suffer from significant shortcomings: they are restricted to symmetric systems, have performance that degrades exponentially in the number of servers, require communication through shared randomness and unique identifiers, and are computationally demanding. In contrast, we provide a simple learning algorithm that, when run decentrally by each agent, avoids the shortcomings of 'global coordination' and leads to efficient performance in general asymmetric bipartite queuing networks while also having additional robustness properties. Along the way, we provide the first UCB-based algorithm for the centralized case of the problem, which resolves an open question by Krishnasamy, Sen, Johari, and Shakkottai (NeurIPS'16 / OR'21). The paper on which this talk is based is joint work with Daniel Freund and Wentao Weng and can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03324.

      title: "The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems, and their Implications for Machine Learning"
      abstract: "The theme of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics was the study of complex systems. At the most basic level, complex systems consist of units and their interactions. In this talk, I will describe each step of a data analysis pipeline suitable for the study of complex systems: from the system dependencies that can manifest themselves in different flavors (temporal, subset, and spatial) to the common mathematical representations (such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), their underlying assumptions, and the dependencies they encode. I will discuss the mathematical relationships between representations and explain how information can be lost (or imputed) when we convert data from one representation to another. I will use examples to highlight the importance of dependencies and careful choice of representations and algorithms when studying complex systems. The main message of the talk is that there is no perfect way to analyze a complex system, and that modeling decisions made when examining a data set from one system are not necessarily transferable to another system, or even to another data set from the same system. Yet, I see many studies apply certain pipelines for seemingly no other reason than because they are common in a particular field. Instead, I recommend evaluating and studying each new complex system and dataset individually and questioning each assumption and modeling decision. This talk is based on the following paper: Leo Torres, Ann Sizemore Blevins, Danielle S. Bassett, Tina Eliassi-Rad: The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems. SIAM Review 63(3): 435-485 (2021), https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1355896. Time permitting, I will describe work on measuring the distance between two graphs by relying on the theory of the length spectrum function from algebraic topology and its relationship to the non-backtracking cycles of a graph. This work is joint with Leo Torres and Pablo Suarez-Serrato, and was published in the Journal of Applied Network Science in June 2019 (http://eliassi.org/papers/appliednetsci19_nbd.pdf)."

      abstract: "A recent line of work brings together Algorithmic Game Theory and Behavioral Economics. One approach taken in this line of work is to enrich well-studied settings in Algorithmic Game Theory by considering players that exhibit cognitive biases. In this talk, we will discuss two papers demonstrating this approach in two very different settings. The first paper extends the analysis of classic optimal stopping problems by considering agents that have loss aversion relative to a changing reference point and analyzes their behavior.

      abstract: "Faculty hiring and retention determine the composition of the U.S. academic workforce and directly shape educational outcomes, career trajectories, the development and spread of ideas, and research priorities. But patterns in faculty hiring and retention are dynamic, reflecting societal and academic priorities, generational turnover, and long-term efforts to diversify the professoriate along gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines. In this talk, we'll analyze, at unprecedented scale and resolution, the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting U.S. universities over the decade spanning 2011-2020.

      title: "When Matching Meets Batching: Optimal Multi-stage Algorithms and Applications"
      abstract: "In several applications of real-time matching of demand to supply in online marketplaces --- for example matching delivery requests to dispatching centers in Amazon or allocating video-ads to users in YouTube --- the platform allows for some latency (or there is an inherent allowance for latency) in order to batch the demand and improve the efficiency of the resulting matching. Motivated by these scenarios, I investigate the optimal trade-off between batching and inefficiency in the context of designing robust online allocations in this talk. In particular, I consider K-stage variants of the classic vertex weighted bipartite b-matching and AdWords problems in the adversarial setting, where online vertices arrive stage-wise and in K batches—in contrast to online arrival. Our main result for both problems is an optimal (1-(1-1/K)^K)-competitive competitive (fractional) matching algorithm, improving the classic (1 − 1/e) competitive ratio bound known for the online variants of these problems (Mehta et al., 2007; Aggarwal et al., 2011). Our main technique at high-level is developing algorithmic tools to vary the trade-off between “greedyness” and “hedging” of the matching algorithm across stages. We rely on a particular family of convex-programming based matchings that distribute the demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages, while carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages. More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight matching linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our fractional multi-stage algorithm returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this stage (by solving the convex program). By providing structural decomposition of the underlying graph using the optimal solutions of these convex programs and recursively connecting the regularizers together, we develop a new multi-stage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive ratio of this algorithm. We extend our results to integral allocations in the vertex weighted b-matching problem with large budgets, and in the AdWords problem with small bid over budget ratios. I will also briefly mention a recent extension of these results to the multi-stage configuration allocation problem and its applications to video-ads. The talk is based on a series of work with Yiding Feng and Amin Saberi:

      title: "A New Design-Based Framework for Randomized Experiments and the Riesz Estimator"
      abstract: "Randomized experiments are widely used for investigating causal quantities in a variety of settings, from clinical trials and public policy evaluations to development economics and product development. A standard assumption in designing and analyzing such experiments is that of 'no-interference', which states that a participant’s outcome is only affected by their individual treatment and not by the treatments given to other participants in the experiment. Although standard, this assumption does not hold in many experimental settings, e.g. studies of the effect of vaccines where disease may spread between the participants or cash transfer programs where participants may affect local economies containing other participants. In this talk, I will present a new design-based experimental framework for formulating and investigating causal quantities under complex interference. The framework is expressive in the sense that it allows experimenters to define and investigate new causal estimands based on continuous or discrete treatment assignments under rich and complex interference structures. We present the Riesz Estimator, which is a unified approach to estimation based on insights from functional analysis. Finally, we derive necessary statistical tools (CLT, variance estimators) to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the causal estimand. Joint work with Fredrik Sävje and Yitan Wang."

While this dynamic program has historically been considered intractable, we show that several policy learning approaches are competitive with or outperform classical baseline approaches. In order to train these algorithms, we develop novel techniques to convert historical data into a simulator and present a collection of results that motivate this approach. We also present a model-based reinforcement learning procedure (Direct Backprop) to solve the dynamic periodic review inventory control problem by constructing a differentiable simulator.

      title: "Limits of an Information Intermediary in Auction Design"
      abstract: "We study the classical Bayesian auction setting with a twist: Between the revenue maximizing seller and the buyers lies an intermediary that is better informed about the buyer values. The intermediary now segments the market by selectively releasing information to the seller, who still controls the auction. This process is called signaling and allows the seller to price discriminate. Though one would expect signaling to always help the seller, in the setting with one buyer, Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [AER 2015] showed a remarkable result: Signaling can maximally help the buyer without really helping the seller.  Specifically, there exists a signaling scheme where the seller's revenue does not increase but the item always sells, thereby maximizing the consumer (buyer) surplus. In this talk, we will explore whether such a result is possible in more general settings: First, when the type space of the buyer is “inter-dimensional” with a private budget or deadline in addition to a private value,  and second, when there are multiple buyers in the auction. On the positive side, we show exact and approximation results via new signaling schemes, while on the negative side, we show impossibility results that capture the limits to which information intermediaries can help the buyers.

      title: "The disparate effects of recommending to strategic users"
      abstract: "Recommendation systems are pervasive in the digital economy. An important assumption in many deployed systems is that user consumption reflects user preferences in a static sense: users consume the content they like with no other considerations in mind. However, as we document in a large-scale online survey, user behavior departs from this model in a crucial way: users choose content strategically, with the goal of influencing their future recommendations. We model the user behavior as a two-stage noisy signaling Stackelberg game between the recommendation system and users: in a finite-length first stage, the recommendation system implements a preliminary recommendation policy, to which users respond by strategically consuming content to change the breakdown of content types recommended to them in the future. Based on the user’s preferences as learned in this first stage, in the second stage, the platform commits to a recommendation policy by which it will recommend content to the users. We show that users’ strategic behavior can affect the user experience: at equilibrium in this game, differences in users’ preferences become accentuated as they strategically consume content further outside the mainstream. This effect is particularly strong among users from (statistical) minorities, who must specifically avoid signaling interest in mainstream content in order to ensure the algorithm will show them content related to their minoritized identities. This puts minority users at an unfair disadvantage, where they cannot access mainstream content without the algorithm suppressing the content types that only they (as the minority) enjoy. We next propose three interventions that improve the recommendation quality (both on average and for minority groups) that account for strategic consumption:(1) Adopting a recommendation system policy that uses preferences from a prior, (2) Communicating to users that universally liked (“mainstream”) content will not be used as the basis of recommendation, and (3) Serving content that is personalized-enough yet expected to be liked in the beginning. Finally, we describe a methodology to inform applied theory modeling in incentive-aware learning settings with survey results. Based on joint work with Andreas Haupt (MIT) and Dylan Hadfield-Menell (MIT)."

      title: "Reducing Interference Bias in Online Marketplace Experiments using Cluster Randomization: Evidence from a Pricing Meta-Experiment on Airbnb"
      abstract: "Online marketplace designers frequently run randomized experiments to measure the impact of proposed product changes. However, given that marketplaces are inherently connected, total average treatment effect (TATE) estimates obtained through individual-level randomized experiments may be biased due to violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption, a phenomenon we refer to as 'interference bias.' Cluster randomization, i.e., the practice of randomizing treatment assignment at the level of 'clusters' of similar individuals, is an established experiment design technique for countering interference bias in social networks, but it is unclear ex ante if it will be effective in marketplace settings. In this paper, we use a meta-experiment or 'experiment over experiments' conducted on Airbnb to both provide empirical evidence of interference bias in online market settings and assess the viability of cluster randomization as a tool for reducing interference bias in marketplace TATE estimates. Results from our meta-experiment indicate that at least 19.76% of the TATE estimate produced by an individual-randomized evaluation of the platform fee increase we study is attributable to interference bias and eliminated through the use of cluster randomization. We also find suggestive, non-statistically significant evidence that interference bias in seller-side experiments is more severe in demand-constrained markets, and that the efficacy of cluster randomization at reducing interference bias increases with cluster quality"

      title: "Stable matchings in choice function models: algorithms, polyhedra, and an application to school choice"
      abstract: "In the classical marriage model by Gale and Shapley, agents from one side of the market have a strict ordering of the agents from the other side of the market and vice-versa. The goal is to find a matching that satisfies a fairness condition known as stability. However, strict orders cannot model many preference patterns that arise in problems such as diversification of school cohorts, formation of teams, etc. Hence, much attention has recently been reserved to matching problems where preferences of agents have a more complex behavior, which can be described via certain choice functions. In the first part of this talk, I will investigate algorithmic properties of these models, showing that the classical combinatorial approach based on the distributive lattice of stable matchings and the description of the convex hull of stable matchings as an LP are intimately related. This approach may turn out to be of interest for other problems as well. In the second part of the talk, I will show how certain choice functions can be used to model school admission criteria that take into account well-defined diversity and fairness concerns. I will show the practical relevance of those choice functions by applying them to data from specialized high schools admission in New York City.

      title: "Non-Stationary Bandit Learning via Predictive Sampling"
      abstract: "Thompson sampling has proven effective across a wide range of stationary bandit environments. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, it can perform poorly when applied to non-stationary environments. We show that such failures are attributed to the fact that, when exploring, the algorithm does not differentiate actions based on how quickly the information acquired loses its usefulness due to non-stationarity. Building upon this insight, we propose predictive sampling, an algorithm that deprioritizes acquiring information that quickly loses usefulness. Theoretical guarantee on the performance of predictive sampling is established through a Bayesian regret bound. We provide versions of predictive sampling for which computations tractably scale to complex bandit environments of practical interest. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that predictive sampling outperforms Thompson sampling in all non-stationary environments examined.

      title: "Two F-words in Peer Review (Fraud and Feedback)"
      abstract: "In this talk, we present two major challenges in peer review, propose solutions with guarantees, and discuss important open problems. (1) Fraud: There have been several recent discoveries of fraud in peer review: A group of participants form a coalition, get assigned each other's papers by manipulating the system, and then accept each others' papers. We present an algorithm which mitigates such fraud by randomizing reviewer assignments, and does not rely on assumptions about the malicious behavior. The algorithm yields an optimal-quality assignment subject to the randomization constraints, and we will discuss experiments characterizing this tradeoff. (2) Feedback: Real-world systems rely on feedback about their performance for their continual improvement. A useful means of obtaining feedback about the peer-review process is to ask authors' opinions. However, author opinions are significantly biased by whether their paper was accepted. We formulate this problem and present algorithms to debias such feedback. Our work relies on the key observation that the direction of this bias is known: the program chairs know which authors' papers were accepted.

      abstract: "Those who are being classified are sometimes aware of the classifiers that are being used on them, and may have incentive to change their behavior to try to improve the label they receive. The attitude towards such strategic behavior, both in practice and in theoretical treatment, has generally been quite negative, and this is one of the reasons that the internal workings of high-stakes classifiers are often shrouded in secrecy. However, intuitively, agents who strategically change their behavior in response to incentives set by classifiers may actually be doing everyone a favor: they are helping teach the classifier whether the variables that the classifier depends on are truly meaningful for the task at hand---that is, features that, when changed, affect the true label (as opposed to non-meaningful features that have no effect). Over time, this could push the system to develop better classifiers, and could push individuals to invest more in meaningful variables. We study this issue in an online regression setting.

      title: "How communication networks promote cross-cultural similarities: The case of category formation"
      abstract: 'Individuals vary widely in how they categorize novel phenomena. This individual variation has led canonical theories in cognitive and social science to suggest that communication in large social networks leads populations toward divergent category systems. Yet, anthropological data indicates that large, independent societies consistently arrive at similar categories across a range of topics. How is it possible for diverse populations, consisting of individuals with significant variation in how they view the world, to independently construct similar categories? Through a series of online experiments, I show how large communication networks within cultures can promote the formation of similar categories across cultures. I use the online “Grouping Game” to observe how people construct categories in both small and large populations when presented with the same novel images. I replicate this design for English-speaking subjects in the U.S. and Mandarin-speaking subjects in China. In both cultures, solitary individuals and small social groups produced highly divergent category systems. Yet, large social groups separately and consistently arrived at highly similar categories both within and across cultures. These findings are accurately predicted by a simple mathematical model of critical mass dynamics. Altogether, I show how large communication networks can filter lexical diversity among individuals to produce replicable society-level patterns, yielding unexpected implications for cultural evolution.'

      title: "Online Bipartite Matching and Adwords"
      abstract: 'Over the last three decades, the online bipartite matching (OBM) problem has emerged as a central problem in the area of Online Algorithms. Perhaps even more important is its role in the area of Matching-Based Market Design. The resurgence of this area, with the revolutions of the Internet and mobile computing, has opened up novel, path- breaking applications, and OBM has emerged as its paradigmatic algorithmic problem. In a 1990 joint paper with Richard Karp and Umesh Vazirani, we gave an optimal algorithm, called RANKING, for OBM, achieving a competitive ratio of (1 – 1/e); however, its analysis was difficult to comprehend. Over the years, several researchers simplified the analysis. We will start by presenting a “textbook quality” proof of RANKING. Its simplicity raises the possibility of extending RANKING all the way to a generalization of OBM called the adwords problem. This problem is both notoriously difficult and very significant, the latter because of its role in the AdWords marketplace of Google. We will show how far this endeavor has gone and what remains. We will also provide a broad overview of the area of Matching-Based Market Design and pinpoint the role of OBM. Based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10777.pdf'

In our solution concept (1) firms choose seemingly-optimal strategies given the level of sophistication of their data analytics, and (2) the levels of sophistication form best responses to one another. Under the ensuing equilibrium firms underestimate price elasticities and overestimate advertising effectiveness, as observed empirically. The misestimates cause firms to set prices too high and to over-advertise. In games with strategic complements (substitutes), profits Pareto dominate (are dominated by) those of the Nash equilibrium. Applying the model to team production games explains the prevalence of overconfidence among entrepreneurs and salespeople.'

      abstract: 'Randomized experiments are widely used to estimate causal effects of proposed "treatments" in domains spanning across physical sciences, social sciences, medicine, and technology industries. However, classical approaches to experimental design rely on critical independence assumptions that are violated when the outcome of an individual a may be affected by the treatment of another individual b, referred to as network interference. Under such network interference, naively using popular estimators and randomized experimental designs can result in significant bias and loss of efficiency. We consider heterogeneous linear and polynomial potential outcomes models for network interference, under which we propose simple estimators for the total treatment effect that output unbiased estimates with low variance under simple randomized designs. Our solution and statistical guarantees do not rely on restrictive network properties, allowing for highly connected graph structures. When the network is completely unknown, we provide a simple unbiased and efficient estimator under a staggered rollout randomized design, showing that the flexibility from experimentation implemented over time can remove any requirement of network knowledge. We believe our results are poised to impact current randomized experimentation strategies due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, wide applicability across different network structures, and its statistical guarantees under a flexible hierarchy of network interference models.'

      abstract: 'A reasonable approach to figure this out is to collect training data comprising features of fishermen and their daily catch, and then learn a model mapping fishermen features to the size of their catch. Reasonable as this approach may sound, it will most likely result in a biased model. The reason for this bias is that the training data will miss all those individuals who were not good enough at fishing and decided to become hunters (or do something else) instead. Such self-selection bias is pervasive. From understanding what it takes to be a good college student or company employee to learning from expert demonstrations and understanding strategic behavior in markets, data available for learning statistical models are the results of strategic decisions that have already operated on and filtered out some of the relevant data. I will discuss recent progress on some classical econometric challenges revolving around estimating linear models under self-selection bias, and identification of non-parametric auction models, and present several open directions for future investigation.

      abstract: 'Indivisibilities and budget constraints are pervasive features of many matching markets. But when taken together, these features typically cause failures of gross substitutability—a standard condition on preferences imposed in most matching models. To accommodate budget constraints and other income effects, we analyze matching markets under a weaker condition: net substitutability. Although competitive equilibria do not generally exist in our setting, we show that stable outcomes always exist and are efficient. However, standard auctions and matching procedures, such as the Deferred Acceptance algorithm and the Cumulative Offer process, do not generally yield stable outcomes. We illustrate how the flexibility of prices is critical for our results. We also discuss how budget constraints and other income effects affect classic properties of stable outcomes.

Welfare economics relies on agents’ utility functions: we revisit classical questions in welfare economics, assuming access to agents’ past choices instead of their utility functions. Our main result considers whether there are convex preferences for which some candidate allocation is Pareto optimal. We show that this candidate allocation is possibly efficient if and only if it is efficient for the incomplete relation derived from the revealed preference relations and convexity. Similar ideas are used to address when the Kaldor criterion may be used to make welfare comparisons, what prices can be Walrasian equilibrium prices, and the possibility of a representative consumer when the income distribution is endogenous.

      abstract: "In the first part of this talk, we show that social network dependence can result in /spurious associations due to network dependence/, potentially contributing to replication crises across the health and social sciences. Researchers in these fields frequently sample subjects from one or a small number of communities, schools, hospitals, etc., and while many of the limitations of such convenience samples are well-known, the issue of statistical dependence due to social network ties has not previously been addressed. A paradigmatic example of this is the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Using a statistic that we adapted to measure network dependence, we test for network dependence and for possible spurious associations in several of the thousands of influential papers published using FHS data. Results suggest that some of the many decades of research on coronary heart disease, other health outcomes, and peer influence using FHS data may suffer from spurious estimates of association and anticonservative uncertainty quantification due to unacknowledged network structure. But data with network dependence abounds, and in many settings researchers are explicitly interested in learning about social network dynamics. Therefore, there is high demand for methods for causal and statistical inference with social network data. The second part of the talk describes recent work on causal inference for observational data from a single social network, focusing on (1) new types of causal estimands that are of interest in social network settings, and (2) conditions under which central limit theorems hold and inference based on approximate normality is licensed."

      abstract: "A central goal in the long literature on fair division is the design of mechanisms that implement fair outcomes, despite the participants' strategic behavior. We study this question by measuring the fairness of an allocation using the geometric mean of the agents' values, known as the Nash social welfare (NSW). This objective is maximized by widely known concepts such as the Nash bargaining solution, proportional fairness, and the competitive equilibrium with equal incomes; we focus on (approximately) implementing this objective and analyze the Trading Post mechanism. We consider allocating goods that are substitutes or complements and show that this mechanism achieves an approximation of 2 for concave utility functions, and becomes essentially optimal for complements, where it can reach (1+e) for any e > 0. Moreover, we show that the Nash equilibria of this mechanism are pure and provide individual fairness in the sense of proportionality. (Joint work with Simina Branzei and Vasilis Gkatzelis.

A key step, the factor rotation, is historically controversial because it appears to be unidentifiable. This controversy goes back as far as Charles Spearman. The unidentifiability is still reported in all modern multivariate textbooks. This talk will overturn this controversy and provide a positive theory for PCA with a varimax rotation. Just as sparsity helps to find a solution in p>n regression, we show that sparsity resolves the rotational invariance of factor analysis. PCA + varimax is fast to compute and provides a unified spectral estimation strategy for Stochastic Blockmodels, topic models (LDA), and nonnegative matrix factorization. Moreover, the estimator is consistent for an even broader class of models and the old factor analysis diagnostics (which have been used for nearly a century) assess the identifiability.

Trace approximation finds applications across machine learning and scientific computing, where it is used to compute matrix norms, spectral densities, log-determinants, triangle counts in graphs, and much more. In 1990, Hutchinson introduced an elegant randomized algorithm for the trace approximation problem that has become ubiquitous in practice. I will introduce a simple modified version of this algorithm that provides the same theoretical guarantees, but requires quadratically fewer matrix-vector multiplications, and performs far better in experiments. We pair this result with matching lower bounds based on reductions to communication complexity and hypothesis testing for spiked-covariance matrices. Our lower bounds fall into a broader research agenda of better understanding the computational complexity of basic linear algebra problems in the restricted 'matrix-vector query' model of computation, which generalizes common algorithmic frameworks like linear sketching and Krylov subspace methods.

      abstract: "Over the past ten years, optimal transport has become a fundamental tool in statistics and machine learning: the Wasserstein metric provides a new notion of distance for classifying distributions and a rich geometry for interpolating between them. In parallel, optimal transport has led to new theoretical results on the stability and long time behavior of partial differential equations through the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows. These two lines of research recently intersected in a series of works that characterized the dynamics of training neural networks with a single hidden layer as a Wasserstein gradient flow. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the mathematical theory of Wasserstein gradient flows and describe recent results on discrete to continuum limits. In particular, I will show how passing from the discrete to continuum limit by introducing an appropriate regularization can lead to faster rates of convergence, as well as novel, deterministic particle methods for diffusive processes."

      abstract: "In hot policing, resources are targeted at specific locations predicted to be at high risk of crime; so-called 'hot spots.' Rather than reduce overall crime, however, there is a concern that these interventions simply displace crime from the targeted locations to nearby non-hot spots. We address this question in the context of a large-scale randomized experiment in Medellin, Colombia, in which police were randomly assigned to increase patrols at a subset of possible hotspots. Estimating the displacement effects on control locations is difficult because the probability that a nearby hotspot is treated is a complex function of the underlying geography. While existing methods developed for this 'general interference' setting, especially Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimators, have attractive theoretical properties, they can perform poorly in practice and mislead practitioners. In this talk, I explore the key pitfalls that practitioners should watch out for when conducting this type of analysis, and propose some ways to partially remedy them."

      title: "The Value of Observability in Dynamic Pricing"
      abstract: "We consider a dynamic pricing problem where a firm sells one item to a single buyer in order to maximize expected revenues. The firm commits to a price function over an infinite horizon. The buyer arrives at some random time with a private value for the item. He is more impatient than the seller and strategizes the time of his purchase in order to maximize his expected utility, which implies either buying immediately or waiting to benefit from a lower price. We study how important is to observe the buyer arrival time in terms of the seller's expected revenue. When the seller can observe the arrival of the buyer, she can make the price function contingent on his arrival time. On the contrary, when the seller cannot observe the arrival, her price function is fixed at time zero for the whole horizon. The value of observability (VO) is defined as the worst case ratio between the expected revenue of the seller when she observes the buyer's arrival and that when she does not. Our main result establishes that in a very general setting about valuation and arrival time distributions, the value of observability is bounded by a small constant. To obtain this bound we fully characterize the observable arrival setting and use this solution to construct a random and periodic price function for the unobservable case.

      title: "Design and Analysis of Bipartite (Market) Experiments"
      abstract: "Bipartite experiments are randomized experiments where treatment is applied to one set of units, while outcomes are measured on a different set of units. The interactions between the treated units and the 'outcome' units can be captured by a bipartite graph. Bipartite experiments are a recent object of study in causal inference, whereby treatment is applied to one set of units and outcomes of interest are measured on a different set of units. These experiments are particularly useful in settings where strong interference effects occur between units of a bipartite graph. In market experiments for example, assigning treatment at the seller-level and measuring outcomes at the buyer-level (or vice-versa) may lead to causal models that better account for the interference that naturally occurs between buyers and sellers. In this talk, we will cover the motivation for and formal setting of bipartite experiments. Furthermore, we will explore possible design choices for such experiments, namely clustered randomized designs, as well as various unbiased inference methods."

      title: "Data and Incentives"
      abstract: 'Markets for lending and insurance incentivize good behavior by forecasting risk on the basis of past outcomes. As "big data" expands the set of covariates used to predict risk, how will these incentives change? We show that "attribute" data which is informative about consumer quality tends to decrease effort, while "circumstance" data which predicts idiosyncratic shocks to outcomes tends to increase it. When covariates are independent, this effect is uniform across all consumers. Under more general forms of correlation, this effect continues to hold on average, but observation of a new covariate may lead to disparate impact---increasing effort for some consumer groups and decreasing it for others. A regulator can improve social welfare by restricting the use of either attribute or circumstance data, and by limiting the use of covariates with substantial disparate impact.'

      title: "Identifying the latent space geometry of network models through analysis of curvature"
      abstract: "Statistically modeling networks, across numerous disciplines and contexts, is fundamentally challenging because of (often high-order) dependence between connections. A common approach assigns each person in the graph to a position on a low-dimensional manifold. Distance between individuals in this (latent) space is inversely proportional to the likelihood of forming a connection. The choice of the latent geometry (the manifold class, dimension, and curvature) has consequential impacts on the substantive conclusions of the model. More positive curvature in the manifold, for example, encourages more and tighter communities; negative curvature induces repulsion among nodes. Currently, however, the choice of the latent geometry is an a priori modeling assumption and there is limited guidance about how to make these choices in a data-driven way. In this work, we present a method to consistently estimate the manifold type, dimension, and curvature from an empirically relevant class of latent spaces: simply connected, complete Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature. Our core insight comes by representing the graph as a noisy distance matrix based on the ties between cliques. Leveraging results from statistical geometry, we develop hypothesis tests to determine whether the observed distances could plausibly be embedded isometrically in each of the candidate geometries. We explore the accuracy of our approach with simulations and then apply our approach to data-sets from economics and sociology as well as neuroscience. Paper: https://stanford.edu/~arungc/LCM.pdf"

      title: "Network Cluster-Robust Inference"
      abstract: "Since network data commonly consists of observations on a single large network, researchers often partition the network into clusters in order to apply cluster-robust inference methods. All existing such methods require clusters to be asymptotically independent. We prove that for this requirement to hold, under certain conditions, it is necessary and sufficient for clusters to have low conductance, the ratio of edge boundary size to volume, which yields a measure of cluster quality. We show in simulations that, for important classes of networks lacking low-conductance clusters, cluster-robust methods can exhibit substantial size distortion, whereas for networks with such clusters, they outperform HAC estimators. To assess the existence of low-conductance clusters and construct them, we draw on results in spectral graph theory showing a close connection between conductance and the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Based on these results, we propose to use the spectrum to compute the number of low-conductance clusters and spectral clustering to compute the clusters. We illustrate our results and proposed methods in simulations and empirical applications."

      title: "Investment Incentives in Near-Optimal Mechanisms"
      abstract: 'In many real-world resource allocation problems, optimization is computationally intractable, so any practical allocation mechanism must be based on an approximation algorithm. We study investment incentives in strategy-proof mechanisms that use such approximations. In sharp contrast with the Vickrey-Clark-Groves mechanism, for which individual returns on investments are aligned with social welfare, we find that some algorithms that approximate efficient allocation arbitrarily well can nevertheless create misaligned investment incentives that lead to arbitrarily bad overall outcomes. However, if a near-efficient algorithm "excludes bossy negative externalities," then its outcomes remain near-efficient even after accounting for investments. A weakening of this "XBONE" condition is necessary and sufficient for the result.'

      title: "Dynamic Pricing and Learning under the Bass Model"
      abstract: 'We consider a novel formulation of the dynamic pricing and demand learning problem, where the evolution of demand in response to posted prices is governed by a stochastic variant of the popular Bass model with parameters (α, β) that are linked to the so-called "innovation" and "imitation" effects. Unlike the more commonly used i.i.d. demand models, in this model the price posted not only affects the demand and the revenue in the current round but also the evolution of demand, and hence the fraction of market potential that can be captured, in future rounds. Finding a revenue-maximizing dynamic pricing policy in this model is non-trivial even when model parameters are known, and requires solving for the optimal non-stationary policy of a continuous-time, continuous-state MDP. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic pricing is used in conjunction with learning the model parameters, with the objective of optimizing the cumulative revenues over a given selling horizon. Our main contribution is an algorithm with a regret guarantee of O (m^2/3), where m is mnemonic for the (known) market size. Moreover, we show that no algorithm can incur smaller order of loss by deriving a matching lower bound. We observe that in this problem the market size m, and not the time horizon T, is the fundamental driver of the complexity; our lower bound in fact indicates that for any fixed α,β, most non-trivial instances of the problem have constant T and large m. This insight sets the problem setting considered here uniquely apart from the MAB type formulations typically considered in the learning to price literature.'

      title: "Hierarchical Community Detection for Heterogeneous and Multi-scaled Networks"
      abstract: 'Real-world networks are often hierarchical, heterogeneous, and multi-scaled, while the idealized stochastic block models that are extensively studied in the literature tend to be over-simplified. In a line of work, we propose several top-down recursive partitioning algorithms which start with the entire network and divide the nodes into two communities by certain spectral clustering methods repeatedly, until a stopping rule indicates no further community structures. For these algorithms, the number of communities does not need to be known a priori or estimated consistently. On a broad class of hierarchical network models, our algorithms are proved to achieve the exact recovery for sparse networks with expected node degrees logarithmic in the network size, and are computationally more efficient than non-hierarchical spectral clustering algorithms. More interestingly, we identify regimes where no algorithm can recover all communities simultaneously while our algorithm can still recover the mega-communities (unions of communities defined by the hierarchy) consistently without recovering the finest structure. Our theoretical results are based on the newly developed two-to-infinity eigenspace perturbation theory for binary random matrices with independent or dependent entries.'

We found the issue with attribution:
By blaming pixels for the prediction (1,2,3,4,5,6).
A complement'ry way to attribute,

      title: "Optimization-friendly generic mechanisms without money"
      abstract: "Our goal is to develop a generic framework for converting modern gradient-descent based optimization algorithms into mechanisms where inputs come from self-interested agents. We focus on aggregating preferences from n players in a context without money. Special cases of this setting include voting, allocation of items by lottery, and matching. Our key technical contribution is a new meta-algorithm we call APEX (Adaptive Pricing Equalizing Externalities). The framework is sufficiently general to be combined with any optimization algorithm that is based on local search. In the talk I'll outline the algorithm, and open problem/research directions that it raises, with a particular focus towards mechanism design + ML. If time permits, I will discuss a special case of applying the framework to the problem of one-sided allocation with lotteries. In this case, we obtain a strengthening of the 1979 result by Hylland and Zeckhauser on allocation via a competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI). The [HZ79] result posits that there is a (fractional) allocation and a set of item prices such that the allocation is a competitive equilibrium given prices. We further show that there is always a reweighing of the players' utility values such that running the standard unit-demand VCG with reweighed utilities leads to a HZ-equilibrium prices. Interestingly, not all HZ competitive equilibria come from VCG prices."

      title: "An Adversarial Approach to Structural Estimation"
      abstract: "We propose a new simulation-based estimation method, adversarial estimation, for structural models. The estimator is formulated as the solution to a minimax problem between a generator (which generates synthetic observations using the structural model) and a discriminator (which classifies if an observation is synthetic). The discriminator maximizes the accuracy of its classification while the generator minimizes it. We show that, with a sufficiently rich discriminator, the adversarial estimator attains parametric efficiency under correct specification and the parametric rate under misspecification. We advocate the use of a neural network as a discriminator that can exploit adaptivity properties and attain fast rates of convergence. We apply our method to the elderly’s saving decision model and show that including gender and health profiles in the discriminator uncovers the bequest motive as an important source of saving across the wealth distribution, not only for the rich."
